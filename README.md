# Stroke_Prediction_and_Analysis
## Context
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.
This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relavant information about the patient.

## **Description**

Here i have done a detailed Exploratory data analysis on the Stroke's data using the various statistical tools and data-visualization tools.
And then i applied numerous 'Classification models' of Machine learning to predict the Stroke occurrence in a patient, and then compared the those models on varioue 'classificatio-metrics' to obtain the best fit model.
